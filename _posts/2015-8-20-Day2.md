##### Additional Material 

* **[ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, Krizhevsky et. al.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)**: One of the papers that really started the neural network revival by showing very impressive scores in the ImageNet competition.
* **[ConvNets in Lasagne tutorial](http://danielnouri.org/notes/2014/12/17/using-convolutional-neural-nets-to-detect-facial-keypoints-tutorial/)**: Tutorial by Daniel Nouri showing how to detect facial key points using convnets in lasagne.
* **[Understanding Convolutions by C. Olah](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Understanding-Convolutions/)**: Blog post with visual explanations of convolutions.
* **[ConvNetJS CIFAR-10 demo](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/cifar10.html)**: In Browser demo shwoing conv nets training on the CIFAR10 dataset. Very good visualizations of ther learned filters. Also check out the [ConvNetJS MNIST demo](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/mnist.html).

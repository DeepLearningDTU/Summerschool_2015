Below you will find links to the software we use to run the exercises. Please ask questions in the comment section below if you have trouble installing some of the software.

### Python
We recommend that you use either [anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) or [canopy](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/) as your python distribution. However any standard python 2.7.x distribution should work. People with computers running Mac OSX have a special Apple version of python. This is however not not always compatible with standard python why we strongly recommend that you install one of the above distributions instead

### Theano
We'll use the python library Theano for automatic differentiation and compilation of fast (GPU compatible) C-code in this course. Install using the **bleeding edge** installation description for [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#bleeding-edge-install-instructions)

### Lasagne
Lasagne is a Neural Network library build on top of Theano. Installation instructions. [Lasagne installation](http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/installation.html)

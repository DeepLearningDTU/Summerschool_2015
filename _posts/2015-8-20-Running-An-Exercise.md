We will run our exercises using Ipython Notebook. To run an exercise do

1. Goto the github repo for the exercise (i.e. https://github.com/DTU-deeplearning/day1-NN)
2. Download and extract the repo on your computer somewhere (press "download zip" button)
3. Open a Terminal/shell and navigate to the folder you just downloaded
4. Start an Ipython notebook server by running 'ipython notebook'. This should open an Ipython notebook server in your browser. Click on the exercise notebook (*.ipynb) to open it and run the code cells by pressing ctrl+enter
